            <td><strong>Abstract:</strong> Exercise and Fitness apps such as Nike Training Club, Sworkit, Fit Radio and MyFitnessPal allow students to customize workouts based on their individual fitness levels. The best part about these apps are most of them are free and easy for students to use. These apps track a variety of different things, such as steps, calories burned, and workout duration, helping students monitor their progress. They also can give students a workout plan to follow and even show videos on how to perform the different exercises. The personalization and ability to track data give students a sense of control and motivation over their fitness journey which can help them feel comfortable and confident in themselves.</td>

            <td><strong>Abstract:</strong> One particular exercise video app that PE teachers are continuing to use in their lesson plans is Just Dance. Just Dance is an active video game that can help students stay active and healthy, but in a unique and fun way. Just Dance can be used by any students no matter their ability. Students can work together in groups or individually and it creates a friendly competition. It is very easy to follow and doesn’t involve any prior dance experience. Students love the music and enjoy the dancing which keeps energy levels high and creates a positive and upbeat environment. It helps students strengthen their balance, coordination and motor skills in an enjoyable way. Most of the time, students don’t even realize how much they are exercising because it is not your typical activities performed in PE.</td>
