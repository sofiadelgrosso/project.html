The data collected can then help PE teachers monitor heart rates and make sure that students are engaging in activities at the correct levels of intensity. It also gives real-time monitoring and allows the teachers to offer immediate corrections. This all helps promote a safer and more effective workout.</td>

By recording steps, calories burned, and duration of physical activity, these devices allow students to see improvements in their fitness levels over the course of time. This data can help motivate students to stay engaged and reach their personal fitness goals that they set for themselves, while also allowing teachers to assess student engagement and performance based on the data.</td>
