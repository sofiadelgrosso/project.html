            <td><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fitness trackers like Apple Watches and Fitbits provide students with immediate feedback about their physical activity. The data collected can then help PE teachers monitor heart rates and make sure that students are engaging in activities at the correct levels of intensity. This helps make sure that all students are participating and staying engaged the entire time. It also provides real-time monitoring which allows the teachers to offer immediate corrections if needed. This all helps promote a safer and more effective PE environment for not only the students, but also the teachers. It also allows students to take more accountability about their workouts and health.</td>

It all gets stored into one place allowing easy access at any time. By recording steps, calories burned, the student’s heart rate and the duration of physical activity, these devices allow students to see improvements in their fitness levels over the course of time. This data can help motivate students to stay engaged and reach their personal fitness goals that they set for themselves, while also allowing teachers to assess student engagement and performance based on the data.</td>
