            <td><strong>Abstract:</strong> In a PE class, there are always more students than there are teachers which means it becomes more challenging to provide one-on-one feedback to each student. By now having technology in the classroom, PE teachers are now using video analysis to record students performing physical tasks like running, throwing, or serving a ball. This footage allows for a detailed review, allowing students to see their technique in real-time and understand how they can improve. It also allows multiple students to be recorded at once making sure that every student gets the opportunity to receive feedback. The teacher can also point out specific aspects of the performance that require adjustment which provides targeted feedback. You can pause the video, slow it down, or even draw on the video and circle something to show the student.</td>

            <td><strong>Abstract:</strong> Video analysis gives students the opportunity to reflect on their movements and make corrections. Every student learns differently, some may be a visual learner, while others might not be. By having students be able to analyze a video of themselves and have it broken down alongside the teacher, students get the opportunity to reflect on their movements and make corrections if needed. With the ability to slow down or even pause the video, students can visually break down each part of the video. This helps students focus on small details that they need to improve on. By having visual feedback, it encourages students to self reflect and it also provides a clear path for students to have the ability to enhance their skills each time they come to class.</td>
